# Internal Timesheet

Project created when I started to work for Accera company as a Technical Leader in order to map the knowledge of the team that I would work with. So I tried to create a simple project with three simple modules (domain, data, and presentation) to practice a little bit some concepts and technologies they were not used to work with. Something like dependence injection, modularization, RxJava, etc! 

Later on, we start an internal tool with the same goal: Share knowledge; And then we left this project here ready to be archived
